This uses the (“Hello Triangle”)[http://www.learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle] tutorial 
from learnopengl.com within an Xcode project that was built using the CMake files from the 
(“Glitter”)[https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter] project on github.

   Our project is using “glad” and “glfw” and has removed the other libraries from Glitter and its CMake file.
(With all the glitter extras, the Xcode project was 700 Mb. Without them it is 9M. 
We also removed the “.git” and “.gitignore” hidden files from the Glitter project so that we could synch it with our
own (“learnOpenGL”)[“https://github.com/mroam/learnOpenGL/”] repository.

   We’ve customized the code to make the triangle rotate. Wahoo!
