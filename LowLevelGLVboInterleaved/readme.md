This is a sample project from "Processing" (version 3.0.2), showing the use of openGL with shaders.
The cross-platform multi-language “Processing” app is available at https://processing.org.

This “.pde” file and its enclosing directory must have the same name (not counting the “.pde” suffix). 
If you rename one, you must rename the other.

(The shaders are separate files, found in the “data” directory.)
