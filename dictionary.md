What is “CMake”?
--------
* “CMake is an extensible, open-source system that manages the build process in an operating system and in a compiler-independent manner. Unlike many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the native build environment.” Is part of Glitter openGL starter and can make xcode project for us. (also windows visual studio, and linux.) Source: http://cmake.org/overview/


What is “FreeGlut”?
--------
* [FreeGlut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net)


What is “glew”?

* ”…“ —http://www.gamedev.net/topic/656534-glfwglutglu-whats-the-best/

* [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net)


What is “glfw”?
--------
* ”a library that creates the context for you (i.e. opens a window for you to draw in, handles input for you, etc.)… (compared to SDL) … SDL offers a little more extra functionality like networking/sound/image loading, GLFW is just context creation and input handling, youll have to load textures yourself or use another library for that (like SOIL)“ —http://www.gamedev.net/topic/656534-glfwglutglu-whats-the-best/
* [glfw](http://www.glfw.org/)


What is “GLM”?
--------
* [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/)

* GLM “OpenGL Mathematics: GLM ...The deprecated/removed features of OpenGL include all the matrix management and manipulation functions that are relied upon by the vast majority of older OpenGL programs. It is possible to recreate your own matrix and math libraries from scratch – and there are a range of books which provide good exemplars for this. However, in this class we will use a third part math library that has been developed for use with OpenGL – GLM. One of the notable features of GLM is that the core functions and types have been based closely on GLSL – so familiarity with GLM should help with GLSL and vice versa. You can download the GLM files from http://glm.g-truc.net/ . GLM is a header only library – so you only need to add the GLM folder to your include path – there are no lib files and there is no dll to worry about..."

What is “GLUT”?
----------
* outdated? —http://www.gamedev.net/topic/656534-glfwglutglu-whats-the-best/


What is “homebrew”?
--------
* Automated software installer/updater for mac that can supposedly download latest versions of open source programs and reconcile their dependencies (glew, x11, freeglut, etc.) Mike is hesitant about installing it: it fiddles with privileges and can [change versions of utilities that system uses](http://discussions.apple.com/thread/4337315?start=0&tstart=0).

* [homebrew](http://brew.sh)

* [install on mac](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20381128/how-to-install-homebrew-on-mac-osx)


What is “Macports”?
--------
* Automated software installer/updater that can supposedly download latest versions of open source programs and reconcile their dependencies (glew, x11, freeglut, etc.) Mike is hesitant about installing it: it fiddles with privileges and can [change versions of utilities that system uses](http://discussions.apple.com/thread/4337315?start=0&tstart=0).

What is ”SDL“?
--------
* Like GLFW, ”a library that creates the context for you (i.e. opens a window for you to draw in, handles input for you, etc.)...SDL offers a little more extra functionality (than GLFW) like networking/sound/image loading, GLFW is just context creation and input handling, youll have to load textures yourself or use another library for that (like SOIL)“ —http://www.gamedev.net/topic/656534-glfwglutglu-whats-the-best/


What is “webGL”?
----------
* It is a “plugin-free 3D to the web, implemented right into the browser. Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), and Opera (Opera) are members of the WebGL Working Group.” (What are its limitations? And how much does it overlap with openGL for mobile devices?)
