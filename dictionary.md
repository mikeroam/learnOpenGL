* GLM “OpenGL Mathematics: GLM ...The deprecated/removed features of OpenGL include all the matrix management and manipulation functions that are relied upon by the vast majority of older OpenGL programs. It is possible to recreate your own matrix and math libraries from scratch – and there are a range of books which provide good exemplars for this. However, in this class we will use a third part math library that has been developed for use with OpenGL – GLM. One of the notable features of GLM is that the core functions and types have been based closely on GLSL – so familiarity with GLM should help with GLSL and vice versa. You can download the GLM files from http://glm.g-truc.net/ . GLM is a header only library – so you only need to add the GLM folder to your include path – there are no lib files and there is no dll to worry about..."

What is “GLUT”?
----------

What is “homebrew”?
--------
* Automated software installer/updater for mac that can supposedly download latest versions of open source programs and reconcile their dependencies (glew, x11, freeglut, etc.) Mike is hesitant about installing it: it fiddles with privileges and can [change versions of utilities that system uses](http://discussions.apple.com/thread/4337315?start=0&tstart=0).
* [homebrew](http://brew.sh)
* [install on mac](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20381128/how-to-install-homebrew-on-mac-osx)

What is “webGL”?
----------
* It is a “plugin-free 3D to the web, implemented right into the browser. Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), and Opera (Opera) are members of the WebGL Working Group.”) (What are its limitations? And how much does it overlap with openGL for mobile devices?)
